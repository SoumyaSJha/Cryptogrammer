# Cryptogrammer
CryptoGrammer is a Python program that allows you to encrypt and decrypt text using different ciphers. The program currently supports the Atbash cipher, the Caesar cipher, and the A1Z26 cipher.

## Ciphers
### Atbash Cipher
The Atbash cipher is a simple substitution cipher that replaces each letter of the alphabet with its reverse, so that "a" becomes "z", "b" becomes "y", and so on.

### Caesar Cipher
The Caesar cipher is a substitution cipher that shifts each letter of the alphabet by a certain number of places down the alphabet. For example, if the shift value is 3, "a" becomes "d", "b" becomes "e", and so on.

### A1Z26 Cipher
The A1Z26 cipher is a simple substitution cipher that replaces each letter of the alphabet with its corresponding number (A=1, B=2, C=3, and so on).

## Usage
To use CryptoGrammer, simply run the program in Python and follow the on-screen instructions. You will be prompted to choose a cipher, whether you want to encrypt or decrypt, and to enter the text to be encrypted or decrypted.
